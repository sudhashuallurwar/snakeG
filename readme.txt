                 ***********************
Most important:- *##Requires GTK+3.0## *
                 *********************** 
work done:-
# first of all, I wondered what exactly GTK is.then after searching on net I found it very interesting and I started it learning.Online tutorial helped me lot.
# I tried small codes for window, dialog, box, table, etc.if it works perfectly then I included in my project.
# The big problem I faced was most information on the net is for pygtk, but gnome-documentation help me a lot.
# first I made layout digram for snakeG's UI i.e top level window containing vbox, hbox, labels, frames, score_box etc.
#  finding out exact difference between containers i.e BOX and TABLE, FRAMES.
# then their:- 
	*signal handling
	*manupulation with array 
	*finding out value for keys 
	*error handling 
	*Flips the key and old_key variable as per every keystroke in window
	*to know why multithreading is required.
	*learning new function srand(), random(), clock()
#Here I used .png to reduce work. 
# making of different function such as food_gen(), collision_p(), collision_q(), display_score() etc.
# printing every value to check whether all function is going correct or not.
# I hope you will Enjoy it!
